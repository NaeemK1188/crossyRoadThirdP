# crossyRoadThirdP

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

I used third person game project in order to create the a chicken character. In the contents folder, you static meshes, blue print folders, and userinterface elements like widgets. The BP folder contains vehicle spawner, trees, rocks spawner, and logs spawner. Also, grass, river, road BP where in each terrian there will be component to be spawned like trees and rock on the grass and road there will be different cars are spawned. another importent Blue print is the game BP that is responsible to spawn the character using game start component that need to be placed in the main view port. Now, the most importent one is the terrain spawner that is responsible for spawning all the lanes with thier contents with the importent component inside it that is box mesh that the game inside it or the game will be spawned. Note the chicken most placed below the box mesh, so the game spawned below the chicken. Finally, the HUD BP in UI folder to add widgets to the screen such as coins and pedometer.
